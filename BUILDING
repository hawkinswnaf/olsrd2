At the moment you need the following things to compile OLSRd2:
1) a C buildchain (normally gcc, but should work with LLVM/Clang)
2) cmake
3) git
4) developer files for libnl-3 (e.g. libnl-3-dev)
5) a built Olsr.org Network Framework

To build the OLSR.org V2 routing agent you first have to build the 
OLSR.org network API (OONF-API). Then you open a shell in the olsrd2
directory and run the following commands:

> cd build
> cmake ..
> make

There are some build variables you can choose to configure building.
We suggest to use ccmake to do this, but the defaults should
be already reasonable.

> cd build
> ccmake ..

If you want to crosscompile the routing agent, you will find a few
examples in the cmake/cross. To compile the code with OpenWRT, you
can use the repository (or a local copy) as an OpenWRT feed.
